# Atomas Component Integration Implementation

## Overview
This document details the integration of React components for the Atomas game, including state management, component architecture, and performance optimizations.

## Component Architecture

### State Management
- Implemented custom `useGame` hook to manage game state and logic
- Used `useRef` to maintain GameEngine instance across renders
- Leveraged `useState` for reactive game state updates
- Utilized `useCallback` for memoized event handlers

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
└── Layout
    ├── GameStatus (score, game over state)
    ├── GameBoard (atoms circle, center atom)
    ├── GameControls (rotation, combine actions)
    └── Reset Button (conditional render)
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. Memoized Components:
   - All game components use React.memo
   - Event handlers wrapped in useCallback
   - Layout component simplified to reduce re-renders

2. State Updates:
   - Single source of truth in GameEngine
   - Efficient state updates via useGame hook
   - Minimized state propagation depth

### Interaction Handling
1. Atom Placement:
   - Click handlers for atom positioning
   - Position calculation based on atom ID
   - Automatic combination checks

2. Game Controls:
   - Clockwise/Counter-clockwise rotation
   - Combine action for middle position
   - Game reset functionality

## Implementation Details

### GameEngine Integration
- Wrapped in custom hook for React integration
- Maintains internal state consistency
- Provides clean API for component interactions

### Component Communication
- Top-down props flow
- Callback-based event handling
- Centralized state management

### Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript interfaces
- Runtime type checking
- Proper prop typing

## Testing Considerations
- Component unit tests
- Integration testing
- Game state verification
- Event handling validation

## Next Steps
1. Add animation system integration
2. Implement sound effects
3. Add difficulty levels
4. Include high score persistence
