# Atomas Game Component Integration Technical Notes

## State Management Strategy

### useGame Custom Hook
- Implements game state management using a React hook
- Uses `useRef` to maintain GameEngine instance across renders
- Provides memoized action handlers with `useCallback`
- Separates game logic from UI components

```typescript
const useGame = () => {
  const gameEngineRef = useRef<GameEngine>(createGame());
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState<GameState>();
  // ... action handlers
}
```

## Component Architecture

### Layout Separation
- Simplified Layout component to handle only structural concerns
- Moved game logic to App.tsx for better state management
- Components are memoized using React.memo for performance

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
└── Layout
    └── GameContainer
        ├── GameStatus
        ├── GameBoard
        │   └── Atom (multiple)
        ├── GameControls
        └── ResetButton (conditional)
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. Memoized Components
   - All game components use React.memo
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed

2. Memoized Callbacks
   - `handleAtomClick` and `handleCombine` use useCallback
   - Dependencies carefully tracked to prevent stale closures

3. Game Engine Reference
   - Stored in useRef to maintain instance across renders
   - Prevents recreation of game engine on re-renders

## Game Interaction Flow

1. Atom Placement
   ```typescript
   handleAtomClick(id: string) {
     const position = atoms.findIndex(atom => atom.id === id);
     placeAtom(position);
   }
   ```

2. Combine Action
   ```typescript
   handleCombine() {
     if (centerAtom) {
       const middlePosition = Math.floor(atoms.length / 2);
       placeAtom(middlePosition);
     }
   }
   ```

3. Game Controls
   - Clockwise rotation
   - Counter-clockwise rotation
   - Atom combination
   - Game reset on game over

## Key Technical Decisions

1. State Management
   - Used custom hook instead of Context API due to localized state
   - GameEngine class handles complex game logic separately

2. Component Responsibility
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Game logic centralized in useGame hook
   - Layout component simplified for better separation of concerns

3. Type Safety
   - Full TypeScript implementation
   - Interface definitions for game state and controls
   - Proper typing for all component props

## Testing Considerations

1. Component Testing
   - Each component is independently testable
   - Memoization doesn't affect test implementation
   - Game logic separate from UI for easier testing

2. Integration Points
   - GameEngine interactions
   - Component event handlers
