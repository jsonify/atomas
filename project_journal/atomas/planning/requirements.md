# Atomas Clone - Initial Requirements

## Overview
Create a React-based clone of the mobile game Atomas, focusing on core gameplay mechanics.

## MVP Features

### Game Interface
- Circular interface where atoms can be placed
- Maximum capacity of 18 atoms
- Visual representation of atoms with different values

### Atom Types
- Normal atoms with values 1-10+
- Plus atoms (for combining)
- Minus atoms (for special actions)

### Game Mechanics
- Ability to place atoms in the circle
- Combining identical atoms using plus atoms
- Score calculation based on atom combinations
- Game over when circle is full (18 atoms)

### Technical Requirements
- Built with React + TypeScript
- State management for game logic
- Score tracking and high score persistence
- Simple visual design with color-coded atoms

### Future Considerations
- Additional atom types
- Special combinations
- Animations and effects
- Sound effects
- Tutorial mode
